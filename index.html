        <p>I'm not a regular mom, I'm a cool mom. My husband and I love staying active with yoga, jiu-jitsu and going to
            the gym. We will be welcoming our 3rd child in 2026! I love
            music and tend to sing things that I could just say regularly, but what's the fun in that? We're excited to
            expand our learning through BYU Pathways. This is such an amazing opportunity and blessing.</p>
